## CHEME-5660 Example Notebooks
This repository holds the example notebooks referenced from the [CHEME 5660 textbook](https://varnerlab.github.io/CHEME-5660-Markets-Mayhem-Book/infrastructure.html). In addition, the notebooks used in the lab section are also available here.

### Installation and Requirments

#### Installing Julia and Pluto
The example notebooks used in lecture, and referenced from the book, are written using the [Pluto notebook package](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) and use the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org).

[Julia](https://julialang.org) is open source, free and runs on all major operating systems and platforms. To install 
[Julia](https://julialang.org) and [Pluto](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) please check out the tutorial for 
[MIT 18.S191/6.S083/22.S092 course from Fall 2020](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/installation/).

1. [Install Julia (we are using v1.8, but future versions of Julia should also work)](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
1. [Install Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl#installation)
1. Clone this repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/varnerlab/CHEME-5660-Markets-Mayhem-Example-Notebooks
    ```
1. From the Julia REPL (`julia`), run Pluto (a web browser window will pop-up):
    ```julia
    julia> using Pluto
    julia> Pluto.run()
    ```
    _Or you can simply type the following in a terminal:_
    ```bash
    julia -E "using Pluto; Pluto.run()"
    ```
1. From Pluto, open one of the `.jl` notebook files located in the `CHEME-5660-Markets-Mayhem-Example-Notebooks/pluto-notebooks/` directoryâ€”enjoy!

#### Installing Jupyter
The labs are provided as [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org); you can find the installation instruction for installing Jupyter [here](https://jupyter.org/install).  For the labs, we use [Julia](https://julialang.org) as our Jupyter notebook kernel; this requires the installation of the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) package. 

To install [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) from the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/) press the `]` key to enter [pkg mode](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/repl/) and the issue the command:

```
add IJulia
```

This will install the [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) package. If you already have Python/Jupyter installed on your machine, this process will also install a
[kernel specification](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kernels.html#kernelspecs)
that tells [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) how to launch [Julia](https://julialang.org) so we can use it in the notebook. You can then launch the [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org) server the usual
way by running `jupyter notebook` in the terminal.
